10. Once you are happy with your selection, click on Apply at the bottom right corner of the plugin window to return to Photoshop.
11. You will see that your image has been divided into two layers: one for the object and one for the background. You can now edit each layer separately or combine them with other images using Photoshop's tools and effects.
