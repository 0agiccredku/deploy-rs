The Airis Kira N7000 is not a very popular device, and it may be hard to find online reviews or feedback from other users. However, there are some videos on YouTube[^1^] that show how to install the Android firmware and how to use the netbook. You can also find the user manual on ManualsLib[^2^], which explains the features and functions of the device in detail.
 
One of the advantages of the Airis Kira N7000 is that it can run different Linux distributions, thanks to the efforts of the kirbian project[^3^]. This project provides various Linux versions for the Airis Kira netbooks, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch. You can download these distributions from SourceForge and install them on your netbook using a USB flash drive. This way, you can enjoy a more versatile and customizable operating system on your device.
 
However, installing Linux on the Airis Kira N7000 may not be easy for everyone, and it may require some technical skills and knowledge. You may also encounter some problems or bugs with some hardware components or drivers. Therefore, you should backup your data and follow the instructions carefully before attempting to install Linux on your netbook. You should also be aware that installing Linux may void your warranty or damage your device.
  
The Airis Kira N7000 is also a very affordable device, compared to other netbooks or tablets on the market. You can find it online for around 150 euros or less, depending on the source and the condition of the device. However, you should be careful when buying it online, as some sellers may not offer a warranty or a refund policy. You should also check the specifications and the compatibility of the device before purchasing it.
 
Another thing to consider when buying the Airis Kira N7000 is the availability and the quality of the customer service and support. Since Airis is not a very well-known or reputable brand, you may have difficulties finding official updates, drivers, manuals, or troubleshooting guides for your device. You may also have problems contacting the customer service or getting a replacement or a repair for your device in case of any issues.
 
Therefore, you should do some research and read some reviews from other users before deciding to buy the Airis Kira N7000. You should also be aware of the pros and cons of this device, and weigh them against your needs and expectations. The Airis Kira N7000 may not be the best netbook or tablet out there, but it may be a good option for some people who are looking for a cheap and portable Android device.
