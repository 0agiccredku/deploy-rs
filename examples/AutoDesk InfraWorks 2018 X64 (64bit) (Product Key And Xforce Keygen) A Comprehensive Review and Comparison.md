Now that you have installed and activated AutoDesk InfraWorks 2018 X64, you might wonder how to connect it with other tools for reality capture, detailed design, analysis, and construction documentation. InfraWorks is a part of the Autodesk Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection, which includes a variety of software for different stages of the project lifecycle. You can use these tools to enhance your InfraWorks models with more data and functionality.
 
For example, you can use BIM 360 Docs to collaborate with your team members and share your InfraWorks models online. BIM 360 Docs is a cloud-based document management platform that allows you to upload, view, and comment on 2D and 3D files from any device. You can also link your InfraWorks models to BIM 360 Docs and sync any changes automatically[^1^]. This way, you can keep your team updated and get feedback on your designs.
 
Another tool that you can use with InfraWorks is Civil 3D, which is a software for civil engineering design and documentation. Civil 3D allows you to create detailed designs of roads, bridges, drainage systems, and other infrastructure elements. You can import your InfraWorks models into Civil 3D and refine them with more accuracy and precision. You can also export your Civil 3D designs back to InfraWorks and visualize them in 3D. This way, you can ensure consistency and compatibility between your models.
 
There are many other tools that you can use with InfraWorks, such as Revit, Navisworks, ReCap Pro, and more. You can find more information about how to connect InfraWorks with other tools in the InfraWorks help documentation. You can also watch tutorials and webinars on the Autodesk website or YouTube channel. By using these tools together, you can create more realistic and comprehensive models of your infrastructure projects.
