A virtual machine is a software that simulates a computer system, allowing you to run different operating systems and applications on your main computer. There are many virtual machine programs available, such as VirtualBox, VMware and Microsoft Virtual PC. In this article, we will show you how to use Microsoft Virtual PC to run Creation Master 09 on Windows 7 64 bit.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Microsoft Virtual PC
 
Microsoft Virtual PC is a free program that lets you create and run virtual machines on your Windows computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702). Choose the version that matches your Windows 7 edition (Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate) and language. After downloading the file, run it and follow the instructions to install Microsoft Virtual PC on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine
 
After installing Microsoft Virtual PC, you need to create a new virtual machine that will run a 32 bit operating system. To do this, open Microsoft Virtual PC from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a window called Virtual PC Console. Click on the New button to start the New Virtual Machine Wizard.
 
The wizard will guide you through the process of creating a new virtual machine. You can choose the options that suit your preferences, but here are some recommended settings:
 
- Choose Create a virtual machine as the type of virtual machine.
- Name your virtual machine as you like, for example FIFA 09.
- Select Other as the operating system.
- Allocate enough memory for your virtual machine, at least 512 MB.
- Choose A new virtual hard disk as the option for your virtual machine's hard disk.
- Specify the location and size of your virtual hard disk file. The default location is in My Documents\My Virtual Machines folder. The size depends on how much space you have on your main hard disk and how much space you need for your virtual machine. A good size is around 10 GB.

After finishing the wizard, you will see your new virtual machine listed in the Virtual PC Console window.
 
## Step 3: Install Windows XP on Your Virtual Machine
 
The next step is to install a 32 bit operating system on your virtual machine. In this case, we will use Windows XP as an example. You will need a Windows XP installation CD or an ISO image file of it. If you have an ISO image file, you can mount it using a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO.
 
To install Windows XP on your virtual machine, follow these steps:

1. Insert your Windows XP installation CD or mount your ISO image file on your main computer.
2. Select your virtual machine in the Virtual PC Console window and click on Start.
3. A new window will open showing your virtual machine's screen. It will be black at first.
4. Click anywhere on the virtual machine's screen and press Shift + Click to capture the mouse and keyboard input. You can release them by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow.
5. In the virtual machine's screen, click on Action > Restart. This will reboot your virtual machine and start the Windows XP installation process.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows XP on your virtual machine. You will need to enter your product key, choose your regional settings, format your virtual hard disk and copy the files.
