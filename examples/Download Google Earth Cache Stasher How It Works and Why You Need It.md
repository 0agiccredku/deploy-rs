# How to Use Downloadgoogleearthcachestasher to Manage Google Earth Cache Files
 
Google Earth is a powerful tool that lets you explore the world in 3D, but it also requires an internet connection to load the imagery and data. If you want to use Google Earth offline, or if you want to save some of your favorite locations for later viewing, you need to manage the cache files that Google Earth stores on your computer.

Cache files are temporary files that Google Earth uses to store the images and data that you see on the screen. They are stored in a folder on your computer, up to a maximum of 2 GB. When the limit is reached, the oldest files are deleted to make room for new ones. This means that you may lose some of the locations that you have visited before, or that you may not be able to see them in high resolution.
 
That's where Downloadgoogleearthcachestasher comes in handy. This is a script that allows you to backup and restore your cache files, so that you can keep them for as long as you want, and use them offline. You can also share your cache files with other users, so that they can see the same locations that you have seen.
