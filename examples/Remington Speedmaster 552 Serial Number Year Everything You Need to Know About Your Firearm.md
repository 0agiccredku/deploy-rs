# How to Identify the Manufacture Date of a Remington Speedmaster 552
 
The Remington Speedmaster 552 is a semi-automatic rifle that can fire .22 Short, .22 Long and .22 long rifle cartridges. It was first introduced in 1957 and is still produced today in an upgraded version. [^3^]
 
If you want to know when your Remington Speedmaster 552 was made, you need to look for the serial number or the barrel code on the left side of the barrel near the charging handle. The serial number was added in October 1967, so if your rifle has one, you can use it to determine the year of manufacture. [^1^]

The serial number consists of two letters followed by a number. The first letter indicates the month of manufacture, using the following code: A - January, B - February, C - March, D - April, E - May, F - June, G - July, H - August, J - September, K - October, L - November, M - December. The second letter indicates the year of manufacture, using the following code: R - 1967, S - 1968, T - 1969, U - 1970, W - 1971, X - 1972, Y - 1973, Z - 1974, I - 1975, O - 1976, Q - 1977. The number indicates the model number of the rifle. For example, a serial number RS68 means that the rifle was made in September 1968 and is a model 552. [^1^]
 
If your rifle does not have a serial number, it was made before October 1967. In that case, you need to look for the barrel code, which consists of two or three letters. The first letter indicates the month of manufacture, using the same code as above. The second letter indicates the year of manufacture, using a different code: B - 1957-58 (first year), L - 1958-59 (second year), A - 1959-60 (third year), C - 1960-61 (fourth year), D - 1961-62 (fifth year), E - 1962-63 (sixth year), F - 1963-64 (seventh year), G - 1964-65 (eighth year), H - 1965-66 (ninth year), J - 1966-67 (tenth year). The third letter, if present, indicates an inspector's mark or a special order code. For example, a barrel code AL means that the rifle was made in January 1959-60 and is a standard model. [^1^]
 
Some earlier rifles have a serial number stamped on the barrel just ahead of the fore-arm. It is slightly offset from the bottom of the barrel. This serial number is not related to the date of manufacture and is only used for inventory purposes. [^1^]

The rifle has a ramp front sight and an adjustable rear sight with windage and elevation knobs. The rifle also has a 3/8 inch dovetail rail for mounting a scope or other optics. The rifle has a cross-bolt safety on the trigger guard that blocks the trigger when engaged.
