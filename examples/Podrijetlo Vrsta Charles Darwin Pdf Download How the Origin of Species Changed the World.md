The book presents Darwin's evidence and arguments for how different species of living organisms have descended from common ancestors over millions of years, and how they have adapted to their environments through a process of variation and survival of the fittest. Darwin also discussed the implications of his theory for human origins, morality, religion, and society.
 
Podrijetlo Vrsta has been translated into many languages, including Croatian. The first Croatian translation was done by Josip BalabaniÄ in 2004, based on the sixth and final edition of the book that Darwin revised in 1872. BalabaniÄ also wrote a preface and shortened some chapters that he considered less relevant or too tedious for modern readers.

Charles Darwin was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England. He came from a wealthy and well-educated family, and he had a passion for natural history since his childhood. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, but he found it boring and gruesome. He then switched to theology at Cambridge University, where he met many influential naturalists and botanists.
 
In 1831, he joined the HMS Beagle as a naturalist for a five-year voyage around the world. This was a turning point in his life and career, as he collected and observed thousands of specimens of plants, animals, fossils, and rocks from different continents and islands. He was especially fascinated by the diversity and similarity of life forms in the Galapagos Islands, where he noticed that each island had its own distinct species of finches, tortoises, and iguanas.
 
After returning to England in 1836, he spent the next two decades analyzing his findings and developing his theory of evolution by natural selection. He was reluctant to publish his theory, as he feared the criticism and controversy it would cause among the scientific and religious communities. However, in 1858, he received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace, a young naturalist who had independently arrived at the same idea of natural selection. Darwin realized that he had to publish his work before Wallace did, and he quickly prepared a summary of his theory for presentation at the Linnean Society of London.
 
The next year, he published Podrijetlo Vrsta, which was an instant bestseller and sparked a heated debate among scientists and the public. Darwin received both praise and criticism for his revolutionary idea, which challenged the prevailing views of creationism and divine design. He continued to work on his theory and published several more books on related topics, such as The Descent of Man (1871), The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), and The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881).
 
Darwin died in 1882 at the age of 73, after suffering from various illnesses for many years. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, near Isaac Newton and other eminent scientists. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest naturalists and thinkers of all time, whose theory of evolution by natural selection has profoundly influenced many fields of science, philosophy, and culture.
