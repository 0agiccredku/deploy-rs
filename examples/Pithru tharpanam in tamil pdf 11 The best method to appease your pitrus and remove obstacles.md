Pithru Tharpanam is a Hindu ritual that is performed to offer gratitude and respect to one's ancestors. The word Pithru means "father" or "forefather" and Tharpanam means "satisfying" or "pleasing". The ritual involves offering water and sesame seeds to the departed souls of one's paternal and maternal lineage, invoking their blessings and seeking their forgiveness for any mistakes or sins committed by oneself or one's family.
 
Pithru Tharpanam is usually performed on Amavasya (new moon) days, which are considered auspicious for ancestral worship. It can also be performed on special occasions such as Pithru Paksha (the fortnight of ancestors), Mahalaya Amavasya (the last day of Pithru Paksha), Shraddha (the anniversary of the death of an ancestor), or during eclipses, when the ancestors are believed to be more receptive to the offerings. The ritual can be done at home, at a temple, or at a sacred river or pond.

The procedure of Pithru Tharpanam varies according to one's region, sect, and tradition. However, some common steps are as follows:
 
- The performer of the ritual should take a bath and wear clean clothes. He should also abstain from eating meat, alcohol, garlic, onion, and other impure substances on the day of the ritual.
- He should prepare a small pit or a plate with sand or rice flour and place some darbha grass (a type of sacred grass) on it. He should also keep some water mixed with black sesame seeds in a vessel or a coconut shell.
- He should sit facing south (the direction of Yama, the god of death) and invoke the presence of his ancestors by reciting their names and gotras (clans). He should also recite some mantras (sacred verses) to praise and appease them.
- He should then pour some water and sesame seeds on the pit or plate with his right hand, while holding some darbha grass with his left hand. He should do this three times for each ancestor, starting from the most recent one and going back up to seven generations. He should also offer some food items such as rice, fruits, sweets, etc. to the ancestors.
- He should then ask for forgiveness from his ancestors for any mistakes or sins committed by him or his family. He should also express his gratitude and request for their blessings and guidance.
- He should then perform a namaskara (a gesture of reverence) to his ancestors and conclude the ritual by reciting some shanti mantras (verses for peace) and sprinkling some water around him.

Pithru Tharpanam is a way of honoring one's roots and maintaining a connection with one's ancestors. It is believed that by performing this ritual, one can attain peace, prosperity, happiness, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
  
Pithru Tharpanam is not only a duty but also a privilege for the Hindus. It is believed that by performing this ritual, one can repay the debts (rinas) owed to one's ancestors for their sacrifices and contributions. It is also a way of expressing one's gratitude and love for one's forefathers and seeking their guidance and protection. According to Manusmriti 3.203, "He who forgets not his departed ancestors even while he is in difficulty, him they remember and bless: 'May this man never fail in his aims'."
 
Pithru Tharpanam also has many benefits for the performer and his family. It is said that by performing this ritual, one can attain wealth, health, happiness, progeny, longevity, fame, and spiritual progress. It also removes any obstacles or doshas (afflictions) caused by the displeasure of the ancestors. It also ensures that one's lineage is continued and one's family name is honored. According to Vishnu Purana 3.14.3, "One who does the shraddha ritual with sincerity pleases Lord Brahma, Indra, Rudra, Ashwinikumaras, Surya, Visvedevas, Pitru Ganas, men, Vasu Ganas, Marut Ganas, animals, cows, Rishiganas and all other small visible and invisible creatures, and thereby, the whole universe."
