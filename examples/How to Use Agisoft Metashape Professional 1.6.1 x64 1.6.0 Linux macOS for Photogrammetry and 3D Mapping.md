## Step 2: Import and Align Your Photos
  
The next step is to import and align your photos in Agisoft Metashape Professional. You can use any type of imagery, such as aerial, close-range, or satellite photos. The software supports auto-calibration of frame, spherical, and cylindrical cameras, as well as multi-camera projects.
  
To import your photos, go to Workflow > Add Photos and select the folder where your images are stored. You can also drag and drop your images into the workspace. The software will automatically detect the camera parameters and EXIF metadata of your photos.
  
To align your photos, go to Workflow > Align Photos and choose the accuracy level and key point limit. The software will perform photogrammetric triangulation and generate a sparse point cloud of your scene. You can view the point cloud and camera positions in the Model view.
  
## Step 3: Build and Edit Your Dense Point Cloud
  
The third step is to build and edit your dense point cloud in Agisoft Metashape Professional. The dense point cloud is a more detailed representation of your scene that contains millions of points.
  
To build your dense point cloud, go to Workflow > Build Dense Cloud and choose the quality level and depth filtering mode. The software will use multi-view stereo reconstruction to create a dense point cloud from your aligned photos. You can view the dense point cloud in the Dense Cloud view.
  
To edit your dense point cloud, go to Tools > Dense Cloud > Edit Dense Cloud and use the selection tools to remove unwanted points or regions. You can also use the automatic classification tool to separate ground points from other objects.
  
## Step 4: Generate and Texture Your 3D Model
  
The fourth step is to generate and texture your 3D model in Agisoft Metashape Professional. The 3D model is a polygonal mesh that approximates the shape of your scene based on the dense point cloud.
  
To generate your 3D model, go to Workflow > Build Mesh and choose the surface type and quality level. The software will use surface reconstruction algorithms to create a 3D mesh from your dense point cloud. You can view the mesh in the Model view.
  
To texture your 3D model, go to Workflow > Build Texture and choose the texture size, blending mode, and color correction options. The software will use photorealistic textures from your original photos to create a textured mesh. You can view the textured mesh in the Model view.
  
## Step 5: Export and Share Your 3D Model
  
The final step is to export and share your 3D model in Agisoft Metashape Professional. You can export your 3D model in various formats, such as OBJ, PLY, STL, FBX, or U3D. You can also export other products, such as digital elevation models (DEM), orthomosaics, or georeferenced data.
  
To export your 3D model, go to File > Export > Export Model and choose the format and settings for your output file. You can also use File >
