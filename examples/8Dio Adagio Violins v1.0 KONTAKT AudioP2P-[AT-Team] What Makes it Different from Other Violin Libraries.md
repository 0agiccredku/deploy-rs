# Review: 8Dio Adagio Violins v1.0 KONTAKT AudioP2P-[AT-Team]
 
If you are looking for a realistic and expressive violin library, you might want to check out 8Dio Adagio Violins v1.0 KONTAKT AudioP2P-[AT-Team]. This is a sample library that features three groups of violins: full ensemble (11 players), small ensemble (3 players) and solo violin (1 player). All of them were recorded in a church environment with three microphone positions (close, far and mixed) and using advanced sampling techniques (such as true legato, deep sampled repetitions and more).
 
What makes this library stand out is the emotion and humanity that the violinists put into their performances. You can hear the nuances and details of every note, as well as the natural dynamics and articulations. The library also includes a variety of patches and presets that cover different styles and genres, from classical to cinematic. You can easily customize the sound and expression of the violins using the intuitive interface and controls.
